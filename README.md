# pico-seed

This is a [pico-stack](https://github.com/telamon/picostack) project template
containing a minimal 'todo'-app using svelte
as template engine.

(You can hack it to use any other framework/template engine if you want, svelte was just what i had lying around.)

[DEMO](https://pico-todo.surge.sh/)

## Getting started
Create your project if you already haven't
```bash
npx degit telamon/picostack-template my-project
```

Then start the local dev-server
```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```
and navigate to [https://localhost:5000](https://localhost:5000)

Other included scripts:
```bash
yarn dev    # Starts local dev-server
yarn test   # Blockend dev: runs unit tests
yarn debug  # Blockend dev: debugs unit tests
yarn build  # Builds production webapp
yarn sinal  # Starts a local swarm singaling server
yarn surge  # Publishes your app to surge.sh
```
